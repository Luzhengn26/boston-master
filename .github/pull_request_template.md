Please go through this checklist before asking anyone for approval.

## My research folder...

- [ ] is prefixed with date in the format `YYYYMMDD_{RESEARCH_NAME}`
- [ ] has a descriptive name
- [ ] uses underscores instead of spaces

## My research notebook/Rmd file...
- [ ] contains all necessary metadata
- [ ] does not contain any PII data shown in any output
- [ ] includes necessary SQL queries used to pull the data to ensure replicability of my work
- [ ] was generated into an HTML file – this is optional if a `link` is provided in the metadata header, but it is mandatory if no `link` is provided

## My research description (metadata in the notebook header)...
- [ ] has a descriptive `title`

- [ ] has a `region` specified that is valid
- [ ] contains relevant keywords for `tags`
- [ ] contains a descriptive `summary`
- [ ] contains a `link` to additional sources (e.g., Google Slides URL) – this is optional if an HTML file is included in your research folder, but it is mandatory if no HTML file is included
- [ ] (optional) contains a `research_team` (only needed if your research has contributions coming from several teams instead of just one; provide the list of teams separated by comma, i.e. Data Team, User Research Team)
- [ ] has no typos!

All checked? You're ready to go!
