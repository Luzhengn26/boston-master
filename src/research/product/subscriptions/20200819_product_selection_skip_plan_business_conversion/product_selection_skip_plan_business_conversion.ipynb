    "summary: Two experiments in the product selection funnel. (1) Premium first - remove the branded plan overview from the funnel to increase % premium. (2) Business conversion - add cashback tags + redesign account purpose step to increase % business. Suggestive evidence for marginal KYC conversion improvement (not significant).  Strong evidence for higher premium x-sell at KYC (1.8pp) and ftMAU (1.7pp).  We decided to roll out this feature.\n",
