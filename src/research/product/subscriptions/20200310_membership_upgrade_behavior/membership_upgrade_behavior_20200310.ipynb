    "summary: Here we aim to answer the question: “How can we leverage data to increase upgrade rates/understand customers that upgrade better?”. We learned that upgraders are much more active + their account balances rise throughout their life cycle: these users use N26 as their main account. Therefore, there are plenty of standard users that are similarly active and have similarly high account balances."
