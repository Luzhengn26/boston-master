    "summary: Taking into account: (1) the significant 7.6pp increase in first time FAU conversion in the first 14 days (5pp FAUs we would never get otherwise by day 45), (2) the additional cost of €0.67 per user to onboarding costs (+5%) (3) the added €1.3mm onboarding costs at +€5.5mm annualized revenue over 2019 and the low fraud rate - We recommend rolling out Stripe as a global solution to increase the first time FAU conversion.\n",
