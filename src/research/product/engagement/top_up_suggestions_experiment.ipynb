    "summary: This experiment was set to validate whether proposing higher amounts at the first top up flow (Stripe) will increase the amount transacted. As a result, suggesting 200â‚¬ for the first Stripe top up resulted on a higher amount for both first and subsequent Stripe transactions. In addition, we found that Stripe is the main method used for the first top up flow."
