    "summary: There is an internal KYC QA team that reviews video KYC verification calls and rates them for quality, on several dimensions. This work aims to analyze whether bad KYC call quality has an effect on the subsequent user journey (card activation and first-time MAU). We are observing the effect of KYC call quality on 1271 users who initiated KYC in the time period from 2020-05-05 until 2020-08-05. We conducted exploratory data analysis, statistical tests (t-test, chi-square test), and logistic regression to analyze the variablesâ€™ relationship and provide a quantified value for the strength of association."

    "There is an internal KYC QA team that reviews video KYC verification calls and rates them for quality, on several dimensions. Our hypothesis is that users who have a bad experience with video KYC will be much less likely to become loyal N26 customers. Could you analyse the data to see if there is support for this hypothesis? Any other interesting findings you turn up from the data would also be useful to share."

    "- **minor** = watch, for internal reporting, no exposure to user\n",
    "- **serious** = error, for internal reporting, no exposure to user\n",
    "- **reset** = for BAFIN/GDPR, the call has to be reset means that the user has to do it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration of call**: 7-8 minutes is acceptable, if it's longer then something didn't go right usually on the user side. If it's a longer call, agent might get irritated which has an impact on user experience of KYC call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio and video quality**: is measured on agent's side, so we don't have any direct insights whether the quality was good on the user side. That could be infered from the duration of the call. If quality on agent side is not good, agent might get irritated too.\n",

    "**Error scoring**: was done by one of the working students. Right now it's not working, but Jasmin can get it working if it proves to be of value for analysis.\n",
