    "summary: V2 of this test removed the explicit promo-code step: we saw overall conversion improvement but also lower % of user with friend referrals on signup. V3 is a redesign of v2 to make promo code field more prominent. No significant boost in SUI to KYCc (7d) (78% confidence in lift < 95%). % SU friend referral goes up by 4pp to 18.5% - v1 was higher on 22.5%. \n",
