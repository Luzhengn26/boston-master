summary: "For our upper sign up funnel (pre-SU), we rely on front-end tracking Snowplow data to understand and infer the market of a user. At signup_initiated step, we capture either the market of website source or the IP geolocation as $COUNTRY variable. After sign up initiation, users select their desired market from the drop down, which is only stored from personal_information step onwards. Hence, we would expect a mismatch in some cases between the $COUNTRY value stored at signup_initiated vs. personal_information+. We aim to employ country stitching method to backfill signup_initiated events (pre-personal_information). We propose to use $COUNTRY value sent at personal_information and waiting_list to backfill predating signup_initiated, and subsequent funnel events. This solution ignores the 6.99% user attempts that have no countries in their attempts, and will address 4.14% user attempts which fall within the 2-country bucket, 0.02% that have more than 2 distinct countries, and future incoming cases. We achieve a reduction of NULL values at signup_initiated step (-27.96%). Our data historically inflated German SUi attempts and deflated the other core markets."
