    "This research provides a quick look into MCU insights and provides some ground for further research. We have looked into four main topics that are summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic introduction to MCU.** Monthly cards user (MCU) is a very similar metric to monthly active user (MAU). The only difference being that only card transactions are counted. With MCU we can see customers, who are making at least one transaction in 35 days. At the moment we have around 1,6 million MCU customers, with a yearly growth of around 30%.\n",
    "2. **MCU conversion.** MCU conversion rate is calculated from customers who have been first time MAUs (ftMAU). ftMAU means that they have made a topup and became ready to use their card. Recently around 75%-70% of customers convert to MCUs in 60 days. However quite many of them lapse, and we have around 52% ftMAU to MCU long-term ratio.\n",
    "3. **Lifetime MCU rate.** When looking at ftMAU/MCU ratio over customer lifetime, we notice at 2 months after becoming ftMAU 76% of customers are MCUs. This number drops to 66% by the 5th month and to 56% after 2 years. We can identify a group of customers that lapse quickly within 4 months, and then another group who gradually lapse within 2 years.\n",
    "4. **MCU influence on MAUs.** This may sound obvious, but MCUs are the main driving force for MAUs. Around 80% of MAUs are also MCUs. We can also see that the ones who are only MAUs have much shorter activity times - proving that card usage creates stronger MAU engagement. Lastly we found out that around 70% of MAUs lapse is caused by lapsing MCUs.\n"

    "## 1. Basic introduction to MCU <a name=\"1\"></a>\n",
    "Monthly card user (MCU) is a metric that displays customers who are active card users on a monthly basis. The metric can be directly comparable with monthly active user (MAU) because it is built with the same parameters. Anyone who understands the MAU concept should find MCU easy, because it's exactly the same, but just limited to card transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Term definitions <a name=\"11\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCU** - monthly card user. A customer who has made at least one card transaction in the past 35 days.\n",
    "- **ftMAU** - first time MAU. A customer who topped up. First time MAU is always a topup of the account. This is important in this context, because a customer who topped up becomes ready to use their card.\n",
    "- **Activity period** - a stretch of time, where the customer had an MCU status. During this time the customer must have at least one card transaction every 35 days. Note that the activity period ends 35 days after the last transaction.\n",
    "- **Card transaction** - a card transaction for MCU is an Authorisation Attempt (AA). We take AAs because of several reasons: AA shows customer agreement to pay, therefore marks activity; AA timestamp is closer to the actual transaction time than PT; MAU is also based on AA transactions, so it allows equal comparison of these two.\n",
    "- **MCU/lifespan ratio** - the percentage of time one customer spends with an MCU status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Customer example <a name=\"12\"></a>\n",
    "Below you can see one example of a customer and his MCU status. Orange color indicates weeks when the customer was an MCU. Green bars display the card transactions this customer made. This chart spans during the whole lifetime of the customer - (s)he joined N26 on week 2019-41 and made their first card transaction on week 2019-51."

    "The main purpose of this chart is to display how MCU status is maintained over 35 day stretches. Note that 35 days is exactly 5 weeks. During weeks 2020-04 and 2020-14 the customer made only one transaction, but because of the 35 day period, the customer maintained MCU status until week 2020-14. Then it stopped as the customer was not making any other transactions in the next half-year.\n",

    "As of this date, our example customer is an MCU since 2020-53. There are some card transactions every other week, but all of them are within 35 days, so the activity is continuous throughout the whole year 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chart we can also visualize the MCU/lifespan ratio, which is 63% for this customer (percentage is not visible on the chart). It is the area covered in orange - the amount of lifetime spent with an MCU status.\n",

    "### 1.3. Activity periods <a name=\"13\"></a>\n",
    "Activity periods (orange time spans in the chart above) are an important part of the concept. If we are seeking to increase card usage and reduce lapses, MCU periods should get longer and more continuous. Ideally covering the whole lifespan of the customer. Lapsing card usage might also be not the worst situation, as long as the customer maintains a high MCU/lifespan ratio.\n",

    "## 2. MCU conversion <a name=\"2\"></a>\n",
    "The fact that the MCU numbers have been steadily growing alone does not really tell us anything. Our customer base has seen a lot of growth and higher numbers of MCU are mostly a consequence of that. Therefore we need to look at the MCU conversion rate from ftMAU customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we take conversion rate from first time MAUs (ftMAU) and not KYC completed (KYCc) customers? Because customers who become first time MAUs are fully ready to use their card and become MCUs. Many customers complete KYC and then don't top up their accounts - this factor does not fall into the cards area. A customer becomes ready to use his card when he has funds in the account, and the topup makes that customer ftMAU. Therefore looking at conversion from ftMAU to MCU makes most sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in the past we have seen an error, where customers can get a virtual card before the first topup. This resulted in many customers who owned a virtual card without becoming ftMAU. Nevertheless, this error does not interfere without our logic because owning a card does not make a customer MCU. To make a card transaction and become ftMCU the customer still needs to top up their account first, so ftMAU will always happen before ftMCU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. MCU 10-week conversion rate <a name=\"21\"></a>\n",
    "Now we can take a 10 week conversion rate. We are taking 10 weeks because it is known that most customers start using the card 2 months after ftMAU, this is discussed later in the research. 10 weeks is slightly more than 2 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chart below displays the percentage of customers who convert from ftMAU to MCU in 10 weeks. X-axis is the month when the customer became ftMAU, and yellow bars display the count of ftMAUs in the cohort. You can see the percentage of customers who became MCU in 10 weeks."

Also it appears that the ratio of MCUs has been going down over the past 3 years, but the trend in 2021 is more stable.
