    "Here you will find a data driven suggestion for an algorithm to save money on cards that were reissued but not used. A combination of three criteria could give us a good guess on whether a customer will reactivate new issued card after their old one has expired. \n",
    "\n",
    "# TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research we came up with an algorithm to decide which customers can be proactively approached with an expired card reissue and which customers should not have a proactive approach. All customers must have a possibility to reissue their card, however we can refrain from proactive reissue where we know that the possibility of using reissued cards is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we could increase the new card activation and usage from 50% to 72% by reissuing almost 40% less cards. We don't need to approach customers who have never used any cards (Potential MCUs) and customers who haven't made any card transaction in the past 6 months (Lapsed MCUs). \n",
    "\n",
    "All other customers could receive a notification to confirm their shipping address and receive a new card (sync reissue). However if someone does not confirm their shipping address, we should only proactively send out (batch reissue) new cards to customers who are MCUs (Monthly Card Users) and have used the expired card in the past 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read further how we came up with this conclusion.\n",

    "# 1. Criteria <a name=\"section1\"></a>\n",
    "After an initial investigation it was decided to use three criteria for the determination of card reissue.\n",
    "1. MCU status - information about user card activity in general.\n",
    "2. Old card last usage - whether the last card was used.\n",
    "3. Reissue type - whether it was a sync or batch reissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on possession of additional card criterion. Initially it was assumed that this could change the data significantly, however it does not. It was not found to be an impactful criterion mostly because old card usage is more valuable. In the end it does not matter whether a customer has additional cards or not, the likelihood of reissued card usage depends more strongly on last card usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note - all cards used in this research are standard. Only standard cards have expired so far, therefore conclusions should be applied with caution for other tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. MCU status <a name=\"criterion1\"></a>\n",
    "MCU status is a good separator of users in terms of their card usage. You can find more about MCU categorisation in [this research](https://research.tech26.de/reports/20220220_mcu_categories.html). However in general we expect different MCU types to behave differently when reactivating their card. See chart below displaying current reissued cards split by their cardholder MCU status (at the time of card reissue)."

    "What we can see in this chart is that customers active with their cards have over 70% usage rate. While the ones who are not active (dormant, lapsed or potential) on the moment of reissue have significantly lower usage rate. There are several insights that we can make straight away:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Potential customers (who have never been MCUs) show no actual potential to activate and use their reissued card. 6% usage rate is very low.\n",
    "2. Lapsed customers have a low usage rate, however 17% activated still contain a large absolute amount of customers, therefore it would be useful to split these out into a group that has a higher usage rate.\n",
    "3. Same for Continuous and Sporadic/Undecided customers. There still is 30% of customers who don't use their cards and it makes sense to split these out as well.\n",
    "4. Dormant customers have a 50% usage rate. From previous research we have information that Dormant customers are either the ones who will return using their card sporadically, or ones who are on their way to being lapsed. Therefore we should also try to split these out. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, to split these categories out we will use the further two criteria that we will discuss in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Expired card usage <a name=\"criterion2\"></a>\n",
    "Second important criterion is the usage of the old expired card. We need to draw a line, on which we can say that the old expired card was abandoned and it is not likely that replacement will be activated. This criterion alone is not a good source of prediction, but it should become very useful when paired with MCU category and possession of secondary card. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chart below should help to determine when can we label old card as <b>abandoned</b>. X axis indicates months since last transaction on the old card while lines indicate how many correct predictions we have on each x as well as the overall accuracy. Note: accuracy is the sum of true positive and true negative predictions over all reissued cards."

    "This topic would probably require a separate research, but what we can notice in the table is that even some used reissued cards have a negative PnL. In all cases where we see a positive PnL per used card, the expired card was used. It looks like this is a good indicator for a used reissued card. However in some categories, e.g. <i>Dormant MCU & Batch reissue & card used</i>, low percentage of used card and low P&L of unused cards overweights the overall sum P&L which ends up negative.\n",

From charts above we can see that these categories make up to [17% of all unused cards] and [9% of all used cards]. Interesting is also that even used reissued cards have a negative P&L on all of these categories. However we don't offer to exclude these cards from reissuing because it's only the first-line P&L that cards generate, and we don't know what is the impact of overall P&L for these users. It would require more investigation on these categories to conclude whether it is beneficial to proactively offer a reissue.\n",
