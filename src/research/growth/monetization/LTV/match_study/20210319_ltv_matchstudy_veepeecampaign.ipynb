    "summary: To assess the success of the Veepee campaign, we addressed the following questions: How does the distribution of profits compare for Veepee users vs. non-Veepee users, that signed up over the same period in France (Oct 4th - Oct 21st 2020)? Can we establish that users from the Veepee campaign are more / less profitable on average than our control group? What is the estimated treatment effect, in Euros, that could be attributed to the Veepee campaign? We compare the predicted LTV / CAC of the Veepee campaign to that of France and the affiliate channel in the month of October. In order to answer question 2, we perform a \"match study\" on our observational data (read \"data that did not result from a proper A/B test setup\"), by borrowing concepts from causal inference. A match study consists in comparing the predicted profits of each user from the treatment group (read \"The Veepee campaign\") to that of N users from the control group. The control group consists of a subset of non-Veepee users from the same period, that have same characteristics: gender, country, kyc_month, channel, first_product, signup_coupon, and marketing_in_app_update_opt_in. The covariates are known to have an effect on predicted LTV in general, and we want to control for them to identify the treatment effect that is coming from the Veepee campaign.\n",
