We found that fully fledged banking features are important and may be necessary for consideration of premium debit card products. More specifically, banking features like bill pay and in-app check deposit may be considered table stakes and not premium features. Also, frictionless banking without fees has the highest level of interest, with simplified discounts (free or one-off), purchase or travel protection and recurring rebates to subscriptions as possible priorities to follow.",Product > Markets,User Research

Some of the main key themes found are that PayPal continues to be used as hub for moving money between multiple accounts. Just over half of respondents say they intend to use N26 as a primary account, with a high rate of unbanked. Many customers who have never had a bank account assumed that N26 is a prepaid card product and expected to be able to deposit cash. The majority of primary debit users tend to rely on mental accounting rather than apps or spreadsheets to help them track spending.

One of our main findings is that when we talked to people about a debit card with rewards, we inevitably ended up talking about credit. Based on what we heard from target customers, we’ve identified 3 opportunity areas for a N26 premium product in the US: a debit card with rewards that serves to reinforce debit spending rather than compete directly with credit; a credit card with radical transparency and guardrails that help avoid the traps of debt; and a best-in-class, comprehensive money management product that goes beyond what people expect from a bank.",Product > US,User Research

People in the UK prefer to pay with card over cash. Unlike in DE, even small transactions are paid with card. Banks are top of mind cash deposits. They are perceived as a one-to-one transaction to convert cash into digital balance; hey are instant, safe and free. Some were also using the post office due to its convenient. People’s concerns about cash deposits vary with the amount of money they want to put into the account. From convenience - finding a place nearby, to security - feeling safe when carrying a large amount of cash. Participants in the UK are comfortable with paying their bills at a store. They seemed less nervous about the social interaction than German participants. PayPoint is the top of mind partner for in-store transactions. Participants know the brand and can recall shops in their area where the service is available. People in the UK are used to getting cash-back at a shop or depositing at a post office. However, they are not familiar with scanning a code for these purposes; they were confused about using their phones as PayPoint transactions/deposits are done by swiping the card. Even though in-store deposits are convenient and participants were positive about them, they were put off by the fee as they can get this at their traditional bank for free",Product > Engagement,User Research

Switchers and Stashers move money at different rates, but both typically move money around the time they get paid. We found that discoverability of account numbers may be significant issue, as users are familiar with ACH and bank login account linking. Also, using a debit card as a funding option was unexpected among all participants and UX copy added to confusion. Finally, transfer speed of Stripe was appealing, but low maximums and fees may not make recurring Stripe valuable to users.",Product > US,User Research

We are also trying to persuade them to intentionally choose a premium account, and to actively use the account that they have chosen. We are interested in how users decide to choose to open an N26 bank account, which account they choose, their account opening experience, as well as how they become onboarded into the bank. This journey starts when users begin to consider N26 for their new bank account.

Additional IBANs were perceived as something serious, not to be played around with. Users found that activating an IBAN was somewhat too easy or too fast. Having controls of bills paid from Spaces was a celebrated feature, but most users found the possibility of cancelling a direct debits practical, but would break contractual ties and ultimately cause more problems than it solves. Some users saw having Space IBAN as a way to set up ‘rules’, by setting up standing orders from the main account to their Space to automatically replenish it.

There are those that lapse due to their own personal situation and those that lapse due to issues in our service delivery. Those that lapse for personal reasons tend to say they have no money right now or can't see an immediate need to use N26. this is likely connected to the fact that they do not plan to use N26 as their primary account. Importantly using the account only for travel (and not being able to travel) has dropped a lot as the reason for lapsing since November 2020. Those that lapse due to issues with service delivery also have lower NPS and are far more likely to say they will close their account.  The reasons they give are often: Missing the French IBAN; They did not receive their card; Adding money to the account is too hard or too expensive,Growth,Growth Insights

Although all the interviewees were overall satisfied with Metal, some shared frictions with N26 regarding: Getting a new card number when upgrading, problems making N26 as a main account and lack of clarity with insurances TnC. The interviewees who are using other banks too, referred to have N26 as “fun” or for daily spendings, withdrawals and transfers. The other accounts mainly keep recurring bills and investments. Travel and leisure were the main topics related to desired perks to get on their metal plan. Cashback findings: As a mental model, customers were explaining they would get cash because ‘money in my account is cashback’. Also, the name reminds them of other cashback programs they have.
